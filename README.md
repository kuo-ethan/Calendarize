# Calendarize

Modern day to-do list apps are great, except for when your to-do list grows long. These apps may be great at organizing your many tasks, but they don't help you make a plan to actually complete them.

Calendarize, a mobile application for iOS devices, is a "smart" to-do list that not only serves as a repository for your tasks, but also suggests personalized and realistic schedules to maximize task completion. Here's how it works:

- `Apple Calendar integration`: Sync your Apple calendar to generate schedules around your personal calendar. This means that events will be automatically added to your Apple calendar!
- `Local calendar`: View a mirror image of your Apple calendar locally, so you don't have to switch over to your Apple Calendar.
- `Task list`: Add, remove, and edit tasks in seconds.
- `Priority tasks`: Distinguish important tasks from non-important tasks, which will be prioritized by the scheduler.
- `Healthy habits`: Tell us your daily healthy habit goals (i.e. gym, prayer, etc.), and we'll automatically incorporate them into your schedule. This includes your sleep schedule.
- `Optimal task scheduling`: Generates schedules that maximize the number of tasks completable while also respecting your daily healthy habits goals.
- `Non-intrusive events`: All Calendarized events will be added to an app-specific "calendar," which can be toggled off in your Apple Calendar if you don't want to view them.
- `Dynamic scheduling`: Generate new schedules at any time. Schedules are randomized (but still optimal), so if you don't like the schedule you get, you can always prompt a new one.

This app is built programmatically using UIKit and a Firebase backend. The local calendar view uses [CalendarKit](https://github.com/richardtop/CalendarKit), a Swift API developed by Richard Topchii.

# Release/Usage
